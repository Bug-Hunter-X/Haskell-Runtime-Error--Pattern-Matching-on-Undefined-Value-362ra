This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell stemming from pattern matching on undefined values. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which throws an exception when attempting to deconstruct an undefined value using a pattern match. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the potential absence of a value using the Maybe monad.  This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in Haskell and illustrates best practices for handling potentially undefined values.
