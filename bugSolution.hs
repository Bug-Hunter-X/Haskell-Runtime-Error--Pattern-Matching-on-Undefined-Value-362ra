The solution is to use the Maybe type to explicitly handle the case where the value might not be defined.
```haskell
import Maybe

myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction Nothing = 0
myFunction (Just x) = x + 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = myFunction Nothing
  print result --This will print 0
  let result2 = myFunction (Just 5)
  print result2 -- This will print 6
  let result3 = myFunction (Just undefined) -- This will NOT cause a runtime error but will compile if you don't include Maybe import
  print result3 -- This will print 1
```
By using Maybe, we ensure the program won't crash; instead, it will handle the Nothing case gracefully.  This is a robust way to manage potentially undefined values in Haskell.
