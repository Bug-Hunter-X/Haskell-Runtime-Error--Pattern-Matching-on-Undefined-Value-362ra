This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on an undefined value, leading to a runtime error.  The problem is that `myFunction` attempts to access `x` in the pattern match without ensuring it's defined.
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction Nothing = 0
myFunction (Just x) = x + 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = myFunction Nothing
  print result --This will print 0
  let result2 = myFunction undefined
  print result2 -- This will cause a runtime error
```
